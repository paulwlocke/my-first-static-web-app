    <h1>Some Javascript Applications</h1>
    <p>
      Below are links to two Javascript applications I wrote a while back.
    </p>
    <ul class="link-list">
      <li><a href="./crossword-tool.html">Crossword Generator</a> - this enables the user to create a rotationally symmetric crossword grid, numbering the clues automatically. 
        There is also an editing feature enabling the user to fill in the answers.</li>
      <li><a href="./sudoku.html">Sudoku Helper</a> - this is a tool to support the solving of Sudoku puzzles. While it can solve some puzzles all by itself, it is of better use in more advanced puzzles, enabling 
      the user to create a hypothesis for a cell's value and argue logically from there. A "reasoning tree" is displayed at the right-hand side and the user
    may undo (revert) a hypothesis. I thought of this as a means of demonstrating the proof technique of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.</li>
    </ul>
